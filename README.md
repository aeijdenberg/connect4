# Connect4

Simple little Connect4 app, built for fun.

```bash
go get github.com/aeijdenberg/connect4/cmd/connect4
connect4
```

You start first, against the computer.

Click to start a new game after you lose.

Use "left" and "right" arrow keys to go back to fix little mistakes.

Use "a" key to toggle auto pilot and "f" to toggle fast mode.

Note the game times out after 2 minutes of inactivity (this was to stop it sucking up CPU if left on).

Enjoy.
