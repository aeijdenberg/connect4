# Connect4

Simple little Connect4 app, built for fun.

You start first, against the computer.

Click to start a new game after you lose.

Use "left" and "right" arrow keys to go back to fix little mistakes.

Note the game times out after 2 minutes of inactivity (this was to stop it sucking up CPU if left on).

Enjoy.
